# Installation (simple)
This is how you install hollyhock-2 onto your calculator:
- Download the newest prebuild release of hollyhock-2: https://github.com/SnailMath/hollyhock-2/releases
- Extract the zip file.
- Download the official updater version 02.01.2 (click the green download button): https://tiplanet.org/forum/archives_voir.php?id=1044960
- Copy the updater into the snail2024 folder
- Double click on Snail2024.exe
- Press enter.
- Connect the calculator via USB.
- On the calculator hold down the `EXP`, `^` and `Clear` keys. With those keys pressed, momentarily press the RESET button on the back of the calculator. Keep the three front buttons pressed until the screen displays the `OS ERROR` message. Don't worry, there is no actual error, this is just the update mode.
- On the computer, Click on OK in the updater until it gets to a progress bar. There will be not text and some error messages will pop up. This is normal. 
- __DO NOT TOUCH__ the calculator until the update is finished.
- When the updater is finished, unplug it and plug it in again
- Select USB Storage and copy all of the files from the apps folder to the calculator (from the folder Snail2024) directly onto the calculator.
- On the computer, click on eject (probably on the bottom right) and eject the calculator.

To start a program, go to the Menu, go to the right, select System, click on the gear on the top left and click on `HollyHock-2 Launcher`

Select the program and click OK.
